# Eduhub(Edusity): Online University Educational Platform

## Overview

This project is a fully responsive online university educational platform built using the React library (via Vite). The platform currently features three main pages:

Landing Page (Homepage): Serves as the main entry point, showcasing information about the university and its offerings.

Explore More Page: Provides additional details about programs, facilities, and other features.

Campus Gallery Page: Displays a collection of campus photos to give visitors a visual representation of the university environment.

The project is deployed on Netlify, with the build version generated using Vite’s efficient bundling process.

## Features

General Features:

1. Fully responsive design for seamless usability across devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
2. Interactive user interface built with React components.
3. Smooth navigation using React Router.
